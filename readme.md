<h4>Re-Roof Over Existing Shingles</h4>
https://youtu.be/PuRoELYoUKY
<br>

<h4>Consumer Reports "How to Shop for Roofing Shingles"</h4>
Within asphalt, there’s a lot to consider. 
<h5>Start by looking at shingle types, including </h5>
<ul>
<li>three-tab,</li>
<li>architectural, and </li>
<li>multilayered</li>
</ul>
In our recent strength tests on products from six manufacturers, we found that the most costly type—multilayered architectural shingles, typically with three to four layers that overlap—generally performs better overall than other styles.
But our testing also revealed lower-cost options with fewer layers that still perform admirably. “For most homes, a top-performing three-tab, which has only one layer, or architectural laminated shingles will work just fine,” says Misha Kollontai, who leads CR’s tests of roofing products.
What’s more, you can find savings among similarly rated multilayered architectural laminated shingles. For instance, Iko Crowne Slate costs $180 per 100 square feet—a standard roofing quantity—compared with CertainTeed Presidential Shake at $325. That’s an 81 percent price difference for similar performance.

<h4>Where do you start?</h4>
<p>
When performing a re-shingling project, the first step is to know the type of material that you will be working on. Of course, you need to match it with the previously installed roofing system. If you change your mind and want a different roofing system, it will be a case for replacement.

In terms of cost and duration of the project, it varies depending on the size of your roof and choice of material. If it is more complicated to install, then it would take longer.
</p>
<h4>Here is a quick rundown of the different types of roofing shingles:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Asphalt-based shingle: It is durable (can last up to 15 to 30 years), attractive, and eco-friendly. However, its protective granules may dislodge and decay due to harsh weather conditions. It also least expensive costing only about $1 to $4 per square foot.</li>
<li>Slate: Made from traditional stones, these are durable, long-lasting, and fireproof. They are expensive and difficult to install but could, later on, increase your property’s resale value. There is also an option to go for synthetic slates which are more lightweight and less expensive.
<li>Wood: It is rust-proof, long-lasting, and classic. Treatments are needed to prevent infestations. It costs more or less $7 per square foot.
<li>Solar: Labor and materials are a huge long-term investment. In fact, it costs as much as $21 per square foot. However, solar shingles could lower electricity costs up to 60%.</li>
<li>Copper: As a metal composition, this is highly wind and fire resistant. It can decrease energy cost but could not filter external noise. This is also on the pricier side at it costs more or less $15 per square foot.</li>
<li>Fiberglass: This is lightweight and cost-effective ($4 to $5 per square foot). However, they are less durable than other types.</li>
 </ul>
 
<h4>Basic Step-by-Step Guide on How to Re-shingle a Roof</h4>
<ol>
You may follow this step-by-step guide on how to reshingle a roof. This is best executed by professionals so make sure to contact a trusted roofer for assistance. On the other hand, it is also good to know the process for your own guidance as a property owner.
<li>Step #1: Inspect your damaged roof</li>
Conduct inspections of the house or building’s internal parts. Look for leaks, dark spots, or water stains on ceilings and walls. Then on the outside, see if there are cracked, curled, or missing shingles. You may also discover plant growth like molds or algae. Doing this will show you exact areas where re-shingling is needed.
Basic Step-by-Step Guide on How to Re-shingle a Roof Getting to your roof is a tricky job and should be done with all safety measures. As we have stated, the general rule is to have a roofing professional assess any kind of damage before you proceed with re-roofing or re-shingling.
 <li>Step #2: Remove or conceal broken shingles</li>
When you have successfully identified which shingles should be replaced, it is now the time to prep the area where you will place them. Remove old and damaged shingles by carefully lifting them up one by one. Clear the area by brushing off any excess product. If you see holes, you also need to conceal them by nailing aluminum flashing. This will cover it completely to prevent penetration of moisture.
 <li>Step #3: Install roofing felt</li>
Install a layer of roofing felt which will act as the base of the new shingles. This waterproof membrane is an important part of the process. It will prevent moisture penetration when it rains. The absence of a roofing felt will promote plant growth and may shorten your roofing’s lifespan.
Make sure that the roofing felt strips slightly overlap each other. To finish it off, secure it with a nail or staple gun.
 <li>Step #4: Draw chalk lines</li>
Using a chalk, draw lines to mark areas where you will place new shingles. Do not forget to measure from end to end for accuracy. In completing this step, take your time and aim for clear precise lines.
The look of your new shingles lies on how carefully you have placed the markings. If done improperly, it might affect the overall look of your roof which is the opposite of what you want to achieve. In simpler terms, it will not look good.
 <li>Step #5: Prepare your new shingles</li>
By the time you are finished marking the areas, you will be able to determine the number of shingles needed to replace old ones. Prepare the shingles for installation by removing the tabs using a knife.
 <li>Step #6: Install the shingles</li>
When you are finally ready to lay the shingles, start by centering the first piece over the line markings. Afterwards, secure it with nails on each corner. Place the next shingle beside it until the first row of shingles is filled. Repeat the process for other areas of your roof.
</ol>

<h4>What do you need?</h4>

<p>Important safety reminders
We cannot emphasize enough how risky this task is. Aside from being difficult, you need to have the right skills to implement the re-shingling correctly. For starters, read about the safety measures you need to keep in mind and abide by to stay protected at all times.
 </p>
 <body>
Wear proper attire complete with safety gears.
Handle nail/staple gun properly. Keep it away from your body and always unplug/disconnect when not in use.
Mount the ladder on an even surface and rest it against a solid structure. Make sure there are no debris or obstructions lying around that may move the ladder.
Do not carry too many tools as it may strain your back. Bring handy tools and avoid taking materials that you do not need.
Be mindful of your surroundings. Check if there are people passing by who might get hit by falling debris. It is also helpful to put a signage to warn other people that there is an ongoing construction.
Take caution at all times because a roofing job is risky and difficult.

 <h3 id="how-to-lay-shingles">How to Lay Shingles</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>Size your shingles appropriately.</li>
Depending on how you're going to organize your rows and courses, some roofers like to cut five variable sizes of shingles when using the basic three-tab variety. Basically, you'll cut off one-half tab-width of the first tab to start the first course, changing the necessary area to fill with each row, shifting the "slots." 

  Usually, the following cuts are useful:
  <ul>
   <li>A half tab off for your first course shingles,</li>
   <li>A full tab for your second course shingles</li>
   <li>1.5 tabs off of your third course shingles,</li>
   <li>2 tabs off your fourth course shingles</li>
   <li>For your fifth course, cut off half of the final tab</li>
   <li>Keep your sixth course tabs intact</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  
  ![Lay starting row at bottom of roof along the edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120050966-9a243180-bfd3-11eb-9048-77f382016542.png)

  <li>Lay a starting row at the bottom of the roof along the edge.</li>
[1] Place nails in the three tab shingles about 3/4 inch (1.8 centimeters) above the cutouts, near where the tab meets the upper part of the shingle. However, make sure that you do not nail into the tar strip. Also place a nail 2 inches from each end of the shingle, in line with the other two. In all, use four nails per 3-tab shingle.
Nailing here will cause the next shingle to cover the nail heads and allow the next and subsequent rows of nails in shingles to always penetrate and hold the top edge of the lower row (this allows 8 nails to hold each shingle).
If the nail gun is firing too deeply, almost mashing through the shingles, then the nails will soon pull through and come loose. Set the air compressor and gun depth setting lower.
<br>
  
  ![Lay 1st row of shingles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120050918-6e08b080-bfd3-11eb-8fe5-f01534773798.png)
  
  <li>Lay the first row of shingles directly covering the narrow starter row.</li>
Snap a horizontal chalk line over the starting row to use as a guide.[2] Cut six inches off the length of the first starter shingle nailed on, then use the rest of them full size. Shifting them in this way will join the ends of the first regular row of shingles placed over the starter shingles. This is the basic, sometimes called "straight up" way of laying shingles.
For the kind of shingles you purchase there may be a special starter row of shingles or a roll of strip material that you cut to the length of your roof.
Alternatively, you can use a starting row of full-sized shingles by turning them with the tabs pointing upward.
<br>

![Lay 2nd row of shingles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051009-cf308400-bfd3-11eb-9438-be647e7e5453.png)

  <li>Lay the second row of shingles.</li>
Set the first shingle of the second row back a half tab, 6 inches (17 centimeters), from the edge of first shingle on the first row and so that the bottom of its tabs just touches the tops of the cutout slots on the shingle below. This 1/2 tab has to be cut off where it hangs off the left edge of the gable roof.
Snap a vertical chalk line from the inside edge of the first shingle on the second row to the top of the roof, and from the inside edge of the first shingle to the top of the roof. These chalk lines will serve as a guide for subsequent even-numbered rows of shingles, and odd-numbered rows, respectively. Continue working horizontally up the roof until you reach the peaks.
<br>
  
![Shingle around stacks, vents & chimneys as needed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051039-ee2f1600-bfd3-11eb-8038-8b331a310805.png)

  <li>Shingle around stacks, vents and chimneys as necessary.</li>
Nail pieces of aluminum sheeting over holes that you can stick your finger through to protect roofing over holes from sagging, dimpling, cracking and leaking.
Stack pipes, vents and chimneys are surrounded with metal flashing laid over tar. Shingles should be interlaced with this flashing, which is usually cemented and nailed-down under upper shingles, but over the shingles on the sides. This is so water will run down the roof but not under the interlacing. For stacks and vents, have the bottom 2 or 3 rows that meet the flashing go under it, while the upper rows go over the flashing.
<br>
  
  ![Interlace the flashing around chimney with rows of shingles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051079-17e83d00-bfd4-11eb-8dd9-72e3edfd1578.png)
<br>
  <li>Interlace the flashing around the chimney with the rows of shingles.</li>
Cement a sheet metal flashing apron over the upper edge of the chimney flange before laying shingles over it and cement another flashing apron over the lower half. Then cover the lower apron on each cemented side layer of flashing that tucks under the top apron using asphalt roofing cement.
<br>
  
  ![Bring ridge edge together with ridge-capping layer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051116-39492900-bfd4-11eb-98ce-9b8bded88981.png)

  <li>Bring the ridge edges together with a ridge-capping layer.</li>
You can either use special shingles called ridge shingles or cut a number of regular shingles into 3 tabbed, equal pieces and bend each so they fit snugly on the roof peak and nail them into place. You'll need longer nails for this part, as you're driving through more layers of shingles.

 <h4>Using Alternate Patterns</h4>
<br>
 
 ![Using Alternate Patterns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051234-b1175380-bfd4-11eb-87ac-6263de99402a.png)

 <h4>1. Understanding the Basic Patterns</h4>
  You'll get the most life out of your shingles and your roof by laying them in a smart pattern. The basic straight up pattern already described is perhaps the easiest and most commonly used, but professional roofers have different opinions about the most proper and efficient method of laying the shingles to get the most life out of them, which differ slightly in the amount of overlap and the pattern in which you install them. 
 The basic patterns include:
 <ul>
  <li>the straight-up pattern</li>
<li>the half pattern</li>
<li>4-inch offset</li>
<li>5-inch offset</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
 
 ![Stagger to achieve 1/2 pattern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051730-9a71fc00-bfd6-11eb-9311-2b1fbac19c3c.png)
 
 <h4>2. Stagger each course to achieve the half pattern.</h4>
All the other patterns work in essentially the same way, offsetting the courses by a particular amount. For the 6-inch or "half" offset, you can protect butt joints and horizontally-moving water by starting a new course 6-inches in every row. Every seventh course, the butt joints will realign and offer stability and protection.
 <br>
 
 ![4" and 5" offsets for added protection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051762-d1481200-bfd6-11eb-951d-c8931de20417.png)

 <h4>3. Consider four and five inch offsets for added protection.</h4>
The method is exactly the same, though the measurement of the offset is slightly different. In an offset of four inches, standard shingles will realign every ten courses, while the five inch offsets will realign every eight. Understanding the benefits of each will help you decide which method to use for your roof:
The short overlap of the four inch offset is somewhat easier, allowing you to use cutouts to overlap every two courses, making less work for you. Unfortunately, because of this, the pattern is less desirable for extremely cold climates or very wet places.
For most DIY roofers, the five-inch offset is the most desirable pattern. It offers the most protection per shingle, making it much less likely that runoff will cut through the in-betweens, hiding shingle irregularities, and getting the most bang for your buck.
 
![Racking? Dbl-check 1st](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051831-2f74f500-bfd7-11eb-8f53-e514a247c081.png)

 <h4>4. Consider "racking" shingles until you reach the top on each side.</h4>
The racking technique uses two sizes of the first shingle of each row, the regular 3 tab pieces and shortened pieces for each end, working vertically rather than horizontally. It goes much faster, allowing you to keep your tools next to you as you work and avoiding having to constantly reposition.
 
Racking shingles sometimes also may create a condition called "pattern curling," where the shingles curl and blow in the wind, at the places where the racked columns join, because of lifting the end of a shingle to place the next shingle and lifting the end high enough to nail the next shingle underneath each of the overlapping shingles. This curling may lead to water getting under shingles, leaking at the places where racked columns meet.
 <br>
In some cases, racking may void the manufacturer's warranty on the expected leak-proofing quality and useful life of some brands of shingles. It's a common practice among contractors.

 <h4>Shingle Type Recommendations for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles</h4>

The heavier the shingle on the new layer, the less likely it is that irregularities in the surface below will telegraph through.

Laminated or other heavy-textured shingles work well, as they do not need to be carefully fitted to the existing shingles, and the irregular texture will conceal any small bumps or dips from the original roof.

 <h4>Prep Work for Re-Roofing Over Asphalt Shingles</h4>

    Inspect the condition of the existing roof and roof deck for numer of roof layers, soundness of roof decking, smoothness of existing roof installation, and other factors that determine whether or not you can do a roof-over or if a roof shingle tear-off is required.

 <h4>Roof Drip Edge Flashing Requirements</h4>

  Roof drip edge flashing serves multiple functions on a building, the foremost of which is to assist water in leaving the roof edge with minimum damage to other building components by directing the water off of the roof and into the gutter.

Without this detail water leaving the roof edge wants to run down building fascias, soffits, and walls, sometimes even entering and damaging the structure.

The drip edge also gives us a nice straight edge with which to align roof shingles, slates or other roofing material.

Drip edge varies in dimensions but typically the flange that nails to the roof surface is about 2.5" wide and the vertical edge that directs roof runoff down and away is about 1.5" in depth.

Lengths of drip vary but typically it's sold in ten foot lengths (120").

The sketch above illustrates the end-profile of roof drip edge flashing and shows its placement on the roof. Usually you won't see much of drip edge as it's under the roof shingles, under the underlayment, and behind the roof gutter.
  
<h4>Where Should Roof Drip Edge Flashing Be Placed ?<h4>

 Our illustration above shows proper placement of the roof drip edge atop the roof sheathing - before installation of roofing felt or ice and water shield and spaced a bit away from the fascia board to improve its drainage.

 <h4>Starter Course for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles</h4>

It is important to nest the new shingles against the old to create a flat surface.

This process starts with a 5-inch starter strip fit along the eaves and set against the second course of existing shingles (see Figure 2-16).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120087251-2cdbd380-c09b-11eb-863f-c954c158deff.png)

DF Notes:
<mark>
Notice that in re-roofing the starter strip is an inch less in width than when installing new shingles over a fresh roof-deck, shown in our asphalt shingle roofing guide at ASPHALT SHINGLE STARTER COURSE INSTALLATION.</mark>

That's to avoid a raised ridge and to let the new full shingle course lay flat atop the original shingles. In essence when I [DJF] installed shingles over an existing roof, for maximum roof life I want the shingles to lay flat - raised ridges in asphalt shingle mean bending that means wear that means shorter shingle life.

So the upper edge of each new shingle course butts against the lower edge of the appropriate existing shingles on the roof above the course being installed. That will let the shingles lay flat on the roof. Only the first course needs support below - that's why we cut a special starter strip of more-narrow width than for a new roof installation.

The special starter strip width is equal to the exposure width (usually 5") of the existing roof.

Even before installing the starter strip or underlayment you should install drip edge flashing along all roof edges.

See DRIP EDGE FLASHING for ROOFS

Next install a course of shingles cut down to 10 inches wide, so they fit against the bottom edge of the existing third course (this creates a new 3-inch first course). After that, shingling should proceed normally, fitting each course up against the bottom of an existing course.
Fastening / Nailing Details When Re-Roofing with Asphalt Shingles

Use galvanized roofing nails long enough to fully penetrate the sheathing, typically 1-1/2 inches for a second roof and 1 3/4 inches for a third. Nesting each new row below an existing one keeps the new nails 2 inches below the existing, which will help minimize any splitting of the sheathing.
Flashings for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles

Depending on their condition and accessibility, some flashings can be reused. New shingles may be able to tuck under existing step flashing, chimney flashings, and front-wall flashings. If they are deteriorated, they must be replaced along with vent boots.

See FLASHING ROOF WALL DETAILS and FLASHING ROOF-WALL SNAFU for specifications of roof-wall flashing and for some photo-examples of troubles with existing step and counter flashing when re-roofing an existing structure.
Valley Details for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles

Any type of valley flashing will work and simply lays over the existing flashing (except in a tear-off, where all flashings should be replaced).

Unless a metal valley flashing is used, the first step is to line the existing valley with a new underlayment consisting of either 90-pound roll roofing or a more durable modified bitumen membrane. Then install either a closed or woven valley as described above.
