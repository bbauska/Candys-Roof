### Guide to Choosing the Right Roofing Shingles

##### 1\. How Much Do Roof Shingles Cost?

Most homeowners pay between $4,700 and $10,460 for a new roof. When budgeting, keep in mind that the cost of installation and labor, as well as the cost of the material itself, will impact your bottom line. You’ll also need to account for the total square footage that your new shingles will cover. If you have a large roof area to cover, you might consider opting for cheaper materials.

```

```

##### 2\. What Is the Slope and Pitch of Your Roof?

Slope refers to how steep the angle of your roof is, and is normally measured with two numbers representing the rise, or height of your roof, and the run, representing it’s length. As an example, a slope of 4:12 indicates that a roof rises four feet and runs 12 feet. Depending on how steep the slope of your roof is, it may not be well suited for heavier roof shingle types, such as slate or clay tiles.

##### 3\. What Are the Weight Limits of Your Structure?

The weights of shingle materials vary widely. That’s why it’s important to know how much weight your home’s structure can safely support before making a decision. Buildings are designated a “dead load” tolerance, or the weight of the roof structure. If the dead load is exceeded, the structure will not be able to support its own weight. The average home has a dead load of around 15 pounds per square foot.

##### 4\. How Will Your Local Climate Affect the New Roof?

Think about the weather patterns in your area during the material selection process. Extreme winds can tear lighter shingles right off, while heavy snow can add dangerous weight to roofs already weighed down by heavy materials. Also, some roofing materials, such as metal, have sun-reflective or cooling properties that make them useful in hot climates. Slate and clay also stand up very well to heat and fire, and are used in some coastal areas for their resistance to high winds.

##### 5\. How Will You Choose a Roof Color?

No one wants their roof to clash with the rest of their house. When choosing shingles, take a look at the colors available for each material. Standard asphalt shingles and slate tiles tend to come in earthy and neutral blacks and grays, but metal can be painted in a wide variety of shades. As a general guideline, darker, more neutral shingles pair well with white and off-white siding, as well as red brick. It may also be worth considering a new paint job for your home to match the new roof.

#### Asphalt/Architectural Shingles

One of the most popular roofing materials in the country, asphalt shingles are easy to install, versatile and budget-friendly. They come in several shapes and sizes, including the basic 3-tab shingle, which can be seen on the roofs of homes around the country and often the most affordable shingles available. Similar to the basic 3-tab shingles are the slightly more expensive architectural shingles and designer asphalt shingles, which can be crafted into a variety of different shapes and styles, from octagonal panels to overlapping square patterns.

```
Average cost: $350 to $500 per square*
Average lifespan: 20 years
```

> “Asphalt shingles possess an overwhelming share of the U.S. steep-slope roofing market and can be reinforced with organic or fiberglass materials. Although asphalt shingles reinforced with organic felts have been around much longer, fiberglass-reinforced products now dominate the market.”

#### Wikipedia Asphalt Shingles"

Architectural or 3-Tab Asphalt Shingles come in two standard design options: Architectural (also known as Dimensional) Shingles, and 3-Tab Shingles. 3-Tab are essentially flat simple shingles with a uniform shape and size. They use less material and are thinner than Architectural Shingles, and are therefore lighter and lower cost for both the material and the installation. They also do not last as long or offer Manufacturer's Warranties as long as good architectural asphalt shingles. 3-Tab are still the most commonly installed in lower-value homes, such as those used as rental properties. However, they are declining in popularity in favor of the architectural style. Dimensional, or architectural shingles are thicker and stronger, vary in shape and size, and offer more aesthetic appeal; casting more distinct, random shadow lines better mimics the appearance of traditional roofing materials such as wood shake shingles.\[7\] The result is a more natural, traditional look. While more expensive to install, they come with longer manufacturer's warranties, sometimes up to 50 Years - typically prorated, as virtually all asphalt shingle roofs are replaced before such an expiration could be reached. While 3-tab shingles typically need to be replaced after 15–18 years, Dimensional typically last 24–30 years. 

#### Consumer Reports "How to Shop for Roofing Shingles"

Within asphalt, there’s a lot to consider.

##### Start by looking at shingle types, including

*   three-tab,
*   architectural, and
*   multilayered

In our recent strength tests on products from six manufacturers, we found that the most costly type—multilayered architectural shingles, typically with three to four layers that overlap—generally performs better overall than other styles. But our testing also revealed lower-cost options with fewer layers that still perform admirably. “For most homes, a top-performing three-tab, which has only one layer, or architectural laminated shingles will work just fine,” says Misha Kollontai, who leads CR’s tests of roofing products. What’s more, you can find savings among similarly rated multilayered architectural laminated shingles. For instance, Iko Crowne Slate costs $180 per 100 square feet—a standard roofing quantity—compared with CertainTeed Presidential Shake at $325. That’s an 81 percent price difference for similar performance. 

#### Where do you start?

When performing a re-shingling project, the first step is to know the type of material that you will be working on. Of course, you need to match it with the previously installed roofing system. If you change your mind and want a different roofing system, it will be a case for replacement.

In terms of cost and duration of the project, it varies depending on the size of your roof and choice of material. If it is more complicated to install, then it would take longer.

#### Here is a quick rundown of the different types of roofing shingles:

*   Asphalt-based shingle: It is durable (can last up to 15 to 30 years), attractive, and eco-friendly. However, its protective granules may dislodge and decay due to harsh weather conditions. It also least expensive costing only about $1 to $4 per square foot.
*   Slate: Made from traditional stones, these are durable, long-lasting, and fireproof. They are expensive and difficult to install but could, later on, increase your property’s resale value. There is also an option to go for synthetic slates which are more lightweight and less expensive.
*   Wood: It is rust-proof, long-lasting, and classic. Treatments are needed to prevent infestations. It costs more or less $7 per square foot.
*   Solar: Labor and materials are a huge long-term investment. In fact, it costs as much as $21 per square foot. However, solar shingles could lower electricity costs up to 60%.
*   Copper: As a metal composition, this is highly wind and fire resistant. It can decrease energy cost but could not filter external noise. This is also on the pricier side at it costs more or less $15 per square foot.
*   Fiberglass: This is lightweight and cost-effective ($4 to $5 per square foot). However, they are less durable than other types.

#### What do you need?

Important safety reminders We cannot emphasize enough how risky this task is. Aside from being difficult, you need to have the right skills to implement the re-shingling correctly. For starters, read about the safety measures you need to keep in mind and abide by to stay protected at all times.

Wear proper attire complete with safety gears. Handle nail/staple gun properly. Keep it away from your body and always unplug/disconnect when not in use. Mount the ladder on an even surface and rest it against a solid structure. Make sure there are no debris or obstructions lying around that may move the ladder. Do not carry too many tools as it may strain your back. Bring handy tools and avoid taking materials that you do not need. Be mindful of your surroundings. Check if there are people passing by who might get hit by falling debris. It is also helpful to put a signage to warn other people that there is an ongoing construction. Take caution at all times because a roofing job is risky and difficult. 

#### Layers to a roof

*   1st Layer: Ice & Water Barrier
*   2nd Layer: Underlayment
*   3rd Layer: Hip & Ridge Shingles
*   4th Layer: Starter Shingles
*   5th (and FINAL) Layer: Deck Seal & Ventilation
    1.  Size your shingles appropriately.
        *   A half tab off for your first course shingles,
        *   A full tab for your second course shingles
        *   1.5 tabs off of your third course shingles,
        *   2 tabs off your fourth course shingles
        *   For your fifth course, cut off half of the final tab
        *   Keep your sixth course tabs intact
    2.  Lay a starting row at the bottom of the roof along the edge.
    3.  Lay the first row of shingles directly covering the narrow starter row.
    4.  Lay the second row of shingles.
    5.  Shingle around stacks, vents and chimneys as necessary.
    6.  Interlace the flashing around the chimney with the rows of shingles.
    7.  Bring the ridge edges together with a ridge-capping layer.
